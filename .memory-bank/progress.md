## Known Issues

### Current Blockers
- None (waiting for task approval to begin)

### Future Known Challenges
1. **Prompt Engineering:** Ensuring LLM never gives direct answers
2. **OCR Accuracy:** Handling poor quality images and complex notation
3. **Math Rendering:** Covering all necessary LaTeX notation
4. **User Experience:** Balancing guidance with student independence
5. **API Costs:** Staying within budget projections

## Recent Changes

### November 3, 2025
- Created Memory Bank structure
- Analyzed PRD thoroughly
- Resolved tech stack question (using OpenAI)
- Proposed adjusted build order
- Documented all technical patterns and decisions

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. Create comprehensive `tasks.md` file
2. Include testing requirements for each task
3. Present to user for review
4. Adjust based on user feedback

### After Approval
1. Initialize project structure
2. Set up development environment
3. Install and configure all dependencies
4. Create basic project scaffolding
5. Begin Day 1 tasks

## Testing Status

### Test Coverage
- Current: N/A (no code yet)
- Target: 70% for core logic

### Test Types Planned
- Unit tests for utilities and services
- Component tests for React components
- Integration tests for conversation flow
- E2E tests (future consideration)

### Problem Types to Test
- [ ] Linear equations (e.g., 2x + 5 = 13)
- [ ] Quadratic equations (e.g., x² + 5x + 6 = 0)
- [ ] Word problems (rate/time/distance)
- [ ] Geometry (area, perimeter)
- [ ] Systems of equations
- [ ] Fraction operations

## Notes

- Memory Bank is comprehensive and ready for development
- Build order has been optimized based on dependency analysis
- Tech stack is finalized (OpenAI, not Claude)
- Waiting for task list approval before starting Day 0
- Timeline is aggressive but realistic for MVP
- Focus on core features first, stretch features later
